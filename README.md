# Assistant

A Discord bot to assist my everyday needs.

[Invite (Private)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=856158596344709130&permissions=8192&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

## Installing

[Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) is required to build Assistant. After Clojure has been installed,
[download the project](https://github.com/KyleErhabor/assistant/releases/latest) and run `clj -T:build uber` to build
it. This may take a while to complete (e.g. a minute).

### Running

In the top-level directory of the project, run:
```sh
java -jar target/assistant-<version>-standalone.jar <token>
```

`<version>` must be the version of the project built, which can be found in the `target` directory. `<token>` must be
the [Discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to authenticate with.
