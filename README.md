# Assistant

![Banner](./banner.png)

A Discord bot to assist my everyday needs.

[Invite (Private)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=856158596344709130&permissions=8192&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

## Rationale

The Discord bot space is oversaturated—why another one?

Discord bots are cool. Before application commands, a bot would read, validate, conform, and process messages as they 
were sent. It was very flexible, but lacked a standardized way to issue commands. While many bots adopted the same
principles, the lack of a system breeded individualism, resulting in prefixes, syntaxes, help commands, and niches
differing between one another. Consequently, users were forced to learn each bot's language and vocabulary.

With application commands, many bots migrated their traditional commands to use interactions, but retained the gimmicks 
and complexities of their former implementations. For example, an `/avatar` command may display a user's avatar with 
links to additional formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF) and sizes, but this is often unnecessary as it adds more 
information than the user needs. The user just wanted *some* image—not all of them in all their forms. The command 
could've been written to use optional parameters, but traditional commands using named arguments (with dashes usually) 
are notoriously difficult to comprehend, resulting in more consults to the help command. These anti-patterns are common 
among bots of all sizes.

I wanted a bot capable of providing a simple interface and experience, but couldn't find one I liked. In protest,
Assistant was created to address those issues—first class support for application commands (subcommands, groups, typed
parameters, autocompletion, etc.) while only showing the details that matter. Assistant's principles are based on what
makes traditional commands and interactions appealing to users and developers and I hope you enjoy its design
philosophy.

## Invite

As Assistant is privately hosted, there is no public instance to invite. Instead, you'll need to [install](#installing)
and invite your own. Use the following invite link, replacing `CLIENT_ID` with your bot's ID, to invite Assistant:
`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&permissions=8192&scope=applications.commands%20bot`

## Installing

You can download the project from the [Releases](https://github.com/KyleErhabor/assistant/releases/latest) page.
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) is required to build it. In the examples, the commands should be 
run in the top-level directory of the project. `<token>` refers to the
[Discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) the bot will use to authenticate.

### Clojure

If you'd prefer to use Clojure directly, run:

```sh
clojure -M -m assistant.core <token>
```

### Java

Run `clj -T:build uber` to build the project. This may take a while to complete (e.g. a minute). Once finished, run:
```sh
java -jar target/assistant-<version>-standalone.jar <token>
```

`<version>` must be the version of the project built, which can be found in the `target` directory.
