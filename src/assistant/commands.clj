  "Command facilities for Assistant.
   
   Commands are declared as functions with `^:command`. The function name, documentation, and metadata is used to
   extract the data about a command to the `commands` and `discord-commands` vars. There's no special handling for
   subcommands or subcommand groups. Conventionally, they're declared as regular functions following the format 
   command-group-subcommand. If the subcommand doesn't have a group, it should be excluded from the name. For example,
   tag-get rather than tag-?-get."
